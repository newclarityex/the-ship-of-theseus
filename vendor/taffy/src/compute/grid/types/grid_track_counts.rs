//! Contains TrackCounts used to keep track of the number of tracks in the explicit and implicit grids.
//! Also contains coordinate conversion functions which depend on those counts
//!
//! Taffy uses two coordinate systems to refer to grid lines (the gaps/gutters between rows/columns):
//!
//!   "CSS Grid Line" coordinates are those used in grid-row/grid-column in the CSS grid spec:
//!     - 0 is not a valid index
//!     - The line at left hand (or top) edge of the explicit grid is line 1
//!       (and counts up from there)
//!     - The line at the right hand (or bottom) edge of the explicit grid in -1
//!       (and counts down from there)
//!
//!   "OriginZero" coordinates are a normalized form:
//!     - The line at left hand (or top) edge of the explicit grid is line 0
//!     - The next line to the right (or down) is 1, and so on
//!     - The next line to the left (or up) is -1, and so on
//!
//! Taffy also uses two coordinate systems to refer to grid tracks (rows/columns):
//!
//!   Both of these systems represent the entire implicit grid, not just the explicit grid.
//!
//!   "CellOccupancyMatrix track indices":
//!       - These are indexes into the CellOccupancyMatrix
//!       - The CellOccupancyMatrix stores only tracks
//!       - 0 is the leftmost track of the implicit grid, and indexes count up there
//!
//!   "GridTrackVec track indices":
//!       - The GridTrackVecs store both lines and tracks, so:
//!           - even indices (0, 2, 4, etc) represent lines
//!           - odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc) represent tracks
//!           - These is always an odd number of
//!       - Index 1 is the leftmost track of the implict grid. Index 3 is the second leftmost track, etc.
//!       - Index 0 is the leftmost grid line. Index 2 is the second leftmost line, etc.
//!
